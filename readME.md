# MIXTE 

MERN Stack APP utilizing the Edamam Recipe & Food Item APIs

## About

I wanted to mess around with the Food & Recipe API's that Edamam offers - and ended up creating this app! My pantry is often stocked with a wide assortment of ingredients, and sometimes it's tough to figure out exactly what your options are. Here - the user can create a digital pantry, and query for recipes based on whichever items they choose.
